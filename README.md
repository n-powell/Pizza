## _Behavior Driven Design_

#### _If a user selects and inputs a topping, It will display that topping._
* _Example:_
* _Input: Pepperoni_
* _Output: Your pizza has Pepperoni_


#### _If a user selects and inputs more than one topping, It will display more than one topping for the pizza._
* _Example:_
* _Input: Pepperoni, Olives_
* _Output: Your pizza has pepperoni, olives._


#### _If a user selects a size, it will display the selected size of the pizza._
* _Example:_
* _Input: large_
* _Output: Your pizza is a large._


#### _If the user selects a different size pizza, that size will be displayed._
* _Example:_
* _Input: small_
* _Output: Your pizza is a small._


#### _If the user inputs both toppings and size, page will display both size and topping selections._
* _Example:_
* _Input: pepperoni; large;_
* _Output: Your pizza is a large pepperoni._

#### _If the user inputs both toppings and size, page will display both size and topping selections, and a *price* for that pizza._
* _Example:_
* _Input: pepperoni; large;_
* _Output: Your pizza is a large pepperoni. Your pizza will be $20_
